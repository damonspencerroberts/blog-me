# Simple Blogging Application

This is a very simple blogging application. Let me explain how it works. 

* At the beginning you come to the home screen and you can click on New Post to create a new post

* From there we get taken to a new post sections where we can enter name, title, content and a photo.

- Note the content can be written in markdown format

* From there the post is sent to another site where the I can verify the post. I then have two choices:

- Submit the post 

- Delete the post

* Once the posts have been verified I can return to the page to view all the posts that have been submitted. I have the main display for the seleceted post and all other posts in chronalogical order. 

- Here is an example of multiple posts being displayed.

I used React and Google Firebase as my data base for the posts.

I hope you enjoy and thank you!
